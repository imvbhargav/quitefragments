### 1. Light.

It was Friday evening, after a day of hectic schedules, meetings, paperwork, and stress. Finally, I got to sit at my favourite spot in a cafe close to home.

Sitting calmly, I listened to the clatter of coffee mugs and the soft hum of voices, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. The roasted aroma of the coffee filled the air, and the warmth of the cup in my hands was all I needed on this cold evening.

That's when I heard him.

> "Can I sit here?" he asked.

The moment I saw him, something felt off - not in a bad way, but in a way as strange and beautiful as watching the moon rise after the sun has set.

"Yeah, no problem," I said.

Then the sun set, night crawled in, and I never realised how long it had been. He asked questions that intrigued me, made me excited to answer. They were nothing different or special - it was just the way he asked that made them special.

We talked about our favourite songs, movies, and my hobby of collecting stamps, and he listened as if each word was being etched into his memory with care.

His laugh, his words, and his experiences were as if the knight from my dreams had become real. It felt as if he already knew me - and had just been waiting for me to arrive.

Finally, after hours of deep conversation, it was time to depart, time to leave him and return to the ordinary. It was already 9 p.m., and tonight was a new moon night. Tired but still exuberant, I finally reached home. It was time to loosen up and hit the bed - alas.
